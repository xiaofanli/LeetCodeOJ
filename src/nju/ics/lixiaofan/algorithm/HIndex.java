/*
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
    	if(citations.length == 0)
    		return 0;
    	int h = 0, n = 0;
    	Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
    	for(int c : citations){
    		if(c > h){
    			if(map.containsKey(c))
    				map.put(c, map.get(c)+1);
    			else
    				map.put(c, 1);
    			
    			n++;
    			if(n == h+1){
    				h++;
    				if(map.containsKey(h))
    					n -= map.get(h);
    			}
